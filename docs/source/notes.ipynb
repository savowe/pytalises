    "The naive intuition of the time propagator to be $\\exp[-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{t_0}^tH(t')\\mathrm{d}t']$, neglecting the time-sorting, is generally not true. If this naive ansatz is inserted into the Schrödinger equation one might expect the equality to hold, however, the time derivative of an exponentiated operator is only well defined if it is diagonal. Yet, generally a Hamiltonian does not commute with itself at different times $[H(t_1),H(t_2)] \\neq 0$, hence they do not have the same eigenbasis and time-sorting has to be applied. Nonetheless, as an approximation for small time steps $\\Delta t$, we will assume that $[H(t),H(t+\\Delta t)] = 0$ holds and the naive ansatz for the time propagator can be used.\n",

    "The Hamiltonian consists of a kinetic $T$ and potential $V$ part. As it is intended to evolve the state vector incrementally over time steps of length $\\Delta t$, it is necessary to calculate the exponential function of a sum of two operators. Since $V$ is dependent on $\\vec{r}$ and the kinetic part consists of the Laplacian operator, it follows (because $[V(\\vec{r}),\\partial_{\\vec{r}}^2] \\neq 0$) that for the operation $\\exp[i\\int(T+V)\\Delta t]$ applied to a wave function, it can generally not be expressed in an appropriate eigenbasis, as both parts are not simultaneously diagonalizable.  \n",

    "we have a sampling rate of $\\delta x = \\Delta x / N$. If we Fourier transform any wave-form, \n",
    "we can safely represent momentum states within $\\Delta k = 2\\pi / \\delta x$. \n",
    "The sampling rate in momentum space is $\\delta k = 2\\pi / \\Delta x$.\n",

    "## Importance of number of sampling points\n",
    "Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) are fastet if the number of grid points of your spatial grid is a multiple of $2$ e.g.: 256, 2048 etc. As every timestep involves at least two FFT we advice you to do so."
