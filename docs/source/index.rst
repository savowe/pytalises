TALISES (This Ain't a LInear Schrödinger Equation Solver) is an easy-to-use
Python implementation of the Split-Step Fourier Method, for numeric
calculation of a wave function's time-propagation under the Schrödinger equation.

As an introduction we recommend reading `Usage and Examples <examples.html>`_  
Even more examples can be found `here <additional_examples.html>`_
If you want to learn about the employed algorithm for solving the Schrödinger equation read `the notes <notes.html>`_
